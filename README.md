## DADA

DADA was originally an idea for a small child to "play on daddy's computer" providing a visually stimulating response for keyboard presses, but upon creating it I realized its mindless randomness could also be calming to adults as well. The functionality is also inspired by Dada Artist Hans Arp's According to the Laws of Chance, but for the digital age. It starts with keyboard mashing, but play with combinations to see what kinds of easter eggs are hidden.    

The project can be started by running 'npm run dev-server'.
